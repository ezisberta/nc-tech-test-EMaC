Please add any additional notes hereâ€¦

1 - Nodemon threw this error: "Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::7000", fixed by changing port.

2 - Both cards.json and sizes.json have the same code, changed sizes to what seems to be a more accurate version considering the expected response objects.

3 - Created test_data to safeguard main data when running tests

4 - (expected sizes for card003 on README don't match data, wrote tests according to data)
